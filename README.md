# FuseBundledHTMLExample
Brute force implementation of bundled web content in Fuse

This example uses some Uno code to search for and extract bundled files and extract them to a `file://` compatible device independent URL that can be used with a WebView. A workaround until a better API can be established. As for the HTML content, relative paths is king.
